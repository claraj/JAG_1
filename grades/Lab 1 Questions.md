## Week 1


### Meters to Feet Converter

Write a program that converts a distance in meters, to the equivalent in feet.
To convert a quantity of meters to feet, multiply the number of meters by 3.28084. 


### Miles from MCTC

/Ask the user how many miles they live from MCTC.

 Once the user has typed in their response,

 *	Display "You live more than 10 miles from MCTC" if they live more than 10 miles away,
 *	Display "You live exactly 10 miles from MCTC" if they live exactly 10 miles away,
 *	Display "You live less than 10 miles from MCTC" if they live less than 10 miles away.

 Use if – else if – else statements.

 
 
### Windows 10 


 To upgrade to Windows 10, a computer needs to have:

 *	Either Windows 7 OR Windows 8 installed
 *	1 GHz or faster processor
 *	2 GB or more RAM

 Write a program that asks the user for the current version of their
 operating system, the CPU speed, and amount of RAM.

 Use && and || in conditions to display a message telling the user
 if they are able to install Windows 10.

 
 
### NASA Astronaut
 
  To become a NASA astronaut, you need to be between 58 and 76 inches tall, so you
  are not too tall to fit in the spaceship, but are tall enough to can reach all the controls.
 
  You also need to be able to swim at least 75 meters when you make a water landing on return to earth.
 
  Write a program to ask the user questions about their height and swimming ability,
  and then use conditional statements to determine if they have potential as a NASA astronaut.
 
  There are many ways of doing this too - once you've written and tested a solution,
  can you think of another way of doing it? Make sure your tests still pass.


### Mail Prices

 USPS charges 49c to mail a standard, rectangular letter.

 USPS charges an extra 21c to mail a non-machinable letter,
 the type of letter that can't be processed by their mail-sorting machines.

 Rectangular letters can be processed by machine. Square, circular or other shaped letters can't be processed by machine.
 Letters must be flat to be processed by machine. Letters that are not flat (with bumps or have a curved shape) can't be processed by machine.

 Write a letter mailing price calculating program.

 Ask the user what shape their letter is - rectangular or not
 Ask the user if their letter is flat or not

 Calculate and display the cost to mail the letter.
 
### Class Setup
 
 Class setup checklist
 
  This isn't really a program, but read through the checklist, complete the items, and update
  the variables as you complete each task so the autograder knows you've done all the things.
